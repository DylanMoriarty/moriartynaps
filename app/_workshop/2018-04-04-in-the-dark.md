_Previously on moriartynaps_; I wrote about **why** I wanted to make a blog space.

Here I'd like to rant about the **how** I'm going about it.

_Letzgo!_

Revisiting old work is always an excerise in self-forgiveness. You can see the ghosts of ambition of making the perfect documentation and clean contributions. In their place you can see the cobbled together creaky scaffolding that *did the thing* _and that was good enough_.

For that reason, revisiting old code is kind of fun in the context of getting another go at it. This site is built using large chunks of code from past Dylan's efforts.

I really love minimalist work with flavors of the fantastic. I can dig Edward Tufte, but man my heart wants William Morris. 

Most of the inspiration for this site can be found from the following folks:

- Mike Bostock

	I saw his website quite a bit while learning D3, and really loved the simplicity of it. Give them a small image to oogle at, a date to see how lazy you've been, and title to _hint_ at what the post was about. It's super simple, no frills, and fantastic.

- Tom MacWright

	Anyone who's homepage uses blue colored underlined links in 2018 is a good person. Tom is a phenominal one. Among other things, the 

- SomethingAboutMaps

	asdfasdfasdf

- Minimally Minimal

	As the name would suggest, the design here is super clean. However, I've long admired Kim's ability to mix fantastically emotional elements in. Namely, his photos and illustrations for each post, & the heart at the end of every post which used to blow up into a small circus of hearts.

Ever since building my first website, I've wanted to get a music player incorporated onto the page so that visitors could listen to a related song for each post.

Autoplaying videos is the worst sin a website can commit– which is a huge bummer for me because if I had my way each page would definitely immediately start blasting great tunes. But I know better. Sadly.

I kicked around a few ideas for how to build this in. The first was to just link out to the video, but immediately taking someone away from my site seemed foolish. 



A lot of websites share much of the same elements. You're gonna see a navigation bar at the top pretty everywhere. This is great for us browsers, as we can land on a new page and not feel totally lost!

I'm not quite bold enough to throw all those conventions out the window, but
