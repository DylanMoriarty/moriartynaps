It's terribly dorky, but I think I'm a professional cartograpy because of Super Mario World.

I've been drawing maps since being a kid, where I spent many, many hours working through games which had overworld maps to explore.

Pretty much all my favorites had em', and outside of navigation they served as a kinda mental progress bar for how much of the game was left.

Most of my favorites involved worlds that changed over time. Whether it was Chrono Trigger, where you visited the same world numerous times over the course of millions of years;

Similarily, the Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past featured a happy-go-lucky world you start in, and then tosses you in a 'darker' version of it fraught with danger.

By the time I took my first carto class in college, I had a few other reasons to be interested in it – mainly from learning how useful the techniques would be in an infographic perspective. But the initial seed was almost certainly planted by game designers of the 90's. Bless em' all.
