I was afraid of the dark.

Why I've worn harry potter spectacles since before Harry Potter was a thing.

Would retreat to the valley between my parents.

From there I'd watch monsters and rainbow dust fall from the ceiling.


At twenty something I had to rush through a forested area in the night without light to get a medical kit. Not conqurering, but at least tolerating the darkness.

I remain impressed by how safe I felt between my two gaurdian mountains despite what my sense were seeing.
