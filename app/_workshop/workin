II. What's the issue
  - GIS projects require multiple files. A source, buffers to it, merged datasets, projections, etc.
  - Re-doing this work if an issue is deteced in there is... oof.
  - When you want to do the same procedure, have to run the tasks again.

III. Enter Command Line Carto!
  + Generally very fast
  + Repeatability
  + Flexability
  + Can incorporate things like folder management, or hook up to other CLI
  - No interface
  - Often bad error messages
  - Hard to learn

IV. History of the Terminal

  - node.js
    - Will allow us to download the rest of the tools easily

    ii. once there, pwd to double check what the filename is.
  3. Now we can write mapshaper commands to do the dirty work for us:
