Command line cartography is the best kept open secret.

1. Why MAKE?
	 - Useful for code-ifying GIS processes that will be repeated.
	 - Easy to edit
	 - Lots of ways to manage files on your comp

	1.5. Why not?
	 - Language is a pain in the keester
	 - For one night stand maps, QGIS is probably faster


How do I get started?

 - xcode for mac users
 - Will want a basic knowledge of command line operations... cd and such - mapshaper!!

3. Let's get (most) of the way there!
	- Active wildfire data
	- Building footprint data

4. More to come!
	- batch processes
	- other useful GIS incorporations
	- saving it as an SVG

5. Lemme know if this is dumb...
