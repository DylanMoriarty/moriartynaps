There's no "new car smell" equivilant for new websites, and that's a bummer.

Instead, there's nothing in the air but cautious optimism. Sure, it's empty now– but oh boy! What it could be!

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}1.
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}What can it be!?
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

This is a harbor for my  daydreams. Instead of losing morning thoughts to walking through doorways, I'd like to catch a few of em' and give them a home.

It will house those scribbles, how-to guides, book recommendations, tunes, etc. etc. Quick, quirky, and wordier thoughts than what would fit well on my main webzone.

Of course, I have a few other goals–

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}2.
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Write More
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

{% include bits/postimg.html imgsrc="posts/nic-cage.jpg" %}

While the readership of this webzone will be exclusive to wanderlust twitter folks & my parents, I work at newspaper where the same can't be said. There's ample opportunity to do my own research and writing, but I'd like to be more confident in writing in general.

You only get good at a skill by doing, and so this is me publicly egging myself to write more. (\*_This also is me giving you permission to shame me if you see this blog-flower wilt from neglect over the course of many months._\*)

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}3.
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Own the Medium
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Much like my main website, this'll be a site largely self-coded. Places like SquareSpace, Medium and such are probably great and easy tools for kicking up a blog quick and easy.

On the otherhand, by making this myself I know how the sausage is getting made. I can also do more fun things, like having big ol' maps displayed, or {% include bits/tooltips.html face="such as adding hover effects to text" tip="wee woo wee woo" %}.



{% include bits/chapter1.html %}4.
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}OK, ...but why naps?
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

...well... _also_... my professional email has been MoriartyMaps for a bit. I like the juxtaposition. A digital dream catcher for the dreamt doodles of a busy napping fella.

Hope ya like it too.

Cheers,

Of course, there are a few other motivations for putting this together...

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}II {% include bits/chapter2.html %}WRITE MORE{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

I don't think many people will read this stuff. That's cool. Props to you for already making it this far! I owe you a high-five already.

While the readership of this webzone will be exclusive to wanderlust twitter folks & my parents (hi mom!), I work at newspaper where the same can't be said. There's ample opportunity to do my own research and writing; I'd like to and will. But I'd also like to be more confident in writing in general.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}OWNING MY WORDS
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Behind every social platform is a 'terms of services' behemoth that no one reads. But as plenty of recent news will show you, every time you 'like' a thing, it's added to the collective profile of who you are, and is then used to judge how you should experience the world.

I don't like that! 

I like sharing things as much as anyone else, giving digital high-five 'likes' to signal encouragement to buddies who are hundreds of miles away doing fucking amazing work is incredible.

But that when I do so much as send a _private message_ with a single reference to the Weinermobile and a sketch to a friend and then immediately start seeing ads for Oscar Meyer online, that's notably creepy! It's like living in a human habitat on mars with shadowy overlords hiding behind one-way mirrors that not only want to observe, but also really want to sell me hot dogs.

I will still like things; I like to like. But at least I'll like on my own(ish) terms. I'm not running Google Analytics or any trackers on these pages, so at least here, _maybe_ I'll be able to talk about wheeled wieners without checking a box in some machine learned marketing list. _Not today, skynet!_

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}IV
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}FEEDING THE BEAST

All super successful websites have a soapbox feature. Somewhere, the page lures you in with big bright beautiful lettering: 

"_Hey, what do you think about this?_"

Is there a phrase that's more of an aphrodisiac? If you think about it, you'll see it everywhere:

- Facebook: Every piece of content you see in your timeline comes pre-baked with an inviting "Write a comment..." block already there, with your face right giving it that real stamp of YOU approval.
- Youtube: Regardless of video subject, genre, or style, seemingly every video ends with thirty seconds of 'that was my opinion, but I can't wait to read about what you think tell me below'.
- Shopping in general: After you buy almost anything online an email shows up shortly afterwards asking you to review the goods.

I don't doubt a lot of that intention is earnest. Given an infinite amount of time, and a very cozy tea shop, maybe all those youtube stars would enjoy sitting down and hearing your opinion on the most recent episode of Dragon Ball. In this life, ain't no one got time for that.

That itch stilll feels sooooo good to scratch. Why yes, I did have a shitty time at this Airbnb where the hallway walls were likely infused with gallons of Canola oil. But for what I paid and for such short notice, no one needs to lose their side hustle over that. 

This site is going to be my soapbox, _but one that is lovingly hand crafted, dammit_. With crazy {% include bits/tooltips.html face="~link styling~" tip="<img src='http://localhost:3000/assets/graphics/posts/1-dreams/byrne-dance.gif'>" %} that is probably not ideal UX.

There will be no comment box here. Your opinion is appreciated but unwanted in these shores. Come chat with me at a cozy tea shop or local dive bar instead.

I'm very bad at keeping journals. In one summer month as a kid I lost three would-be memoirs to leaving them outside in the rain. The one's that I've kept indoors have fared much better, but remain likewise neglected as a record of this Dylan critter.

What I have instead are school notebooks. Most of the pages include notes, but in the gutter and littered throughout are scribbles and records of myself & my buddies during those days. Cleaning was always a treacherous affair for me, as I'd inevitably stumble upon one of these books and get lost for hours recalling the 'Hillary is a Liger' series.

Heck, I even find my first blog, [a four-year-old tumblr](http://eightbears.tumblr.com/) incredibly fun to look back on.

{% include bits/postimg.html class="multiply" imgsrc="posts/1-dreams/dummy.png" %}

There may be less erase marks, and sketched out names I wish to redact. I don't plan on writing about my love life, vendettas, grand heist plans, or day-to-day frustrations – much – but the doors open to some more personal stuff.

I'd enjoy you knowing me better, and will enjoy years down the road {% include bits/tooltips.html face="looking back at this" tip="This site will almost certainly be completely broken or otherwise unloadable in future web browsers 'years down the road'. As such, I will be looking back on print outs of these pages, _I'm sure._" %}.

{% include bits/chapter2.html %}...why "naps?"

...and... _also_... my professional email has been MoriartyMaps for a bit. I like the juxtaposition. A digital dream catcher for the dreamt doodles of a napping busy fella.







{% include bits/chapter1.html %}II {% include bits/chapter2.html %}A hrmmm{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

I've had a mostly full-fledged site good to go many months ago;

<img src="./assets/graphics/posts/2-wip/homepage.png" />

The idea of this site being a "dark night-time" mirror of my main site was the intial intention. After making it though, I kept running into the issue of how to display illustrations on a black background... and none of the solutions I worked up jivved for me.

<img src="./assets/graphics/posts/2-wip/post.png" />

Still love love dark websites, but this ain't gonna be one. If you know of a site that handles sketches on a black backround, let me know!

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III {% include bits/chapter2.html %}So why launch before making this pretty?{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

I don't think many people will read this stuff. That's cool. Props to you for already making it this far! I owe you a high-five already.

While the readership here will certainly be exclusive to wanderlust twitter folks & my parents (hi mom!), I work at newspaper where the same couldn't be said. 

Given the many opportunities to do my own research and write, I'd like to be better at it in general. You only get good at a skill by doing, and so this is me publicly egging myself to write more. 

(\*_This also is me giving you permission to shame me if you see this blog flower wilt from neglect in the upcoming months._\*)

In addition, I know how to do a few things, and know from experience how invaluable 'hey this is how you do this' posts can be. Hope to contribute somehow to the greater good there.
