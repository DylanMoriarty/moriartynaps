I ran around with a DSLR Digital Camera for a lot of high school. Nowdays cell phones have incredible cameras built right into them, but at least when I was 16 phone cameras were bad enough that there was some novelty to getting "professional" shots.

Starting out I took a lot of pictures of things:

Grass! 

Trees! 

Mountains! 

But they always seemed kinda dull to me. 

Photo galleries that line the walls of local libraries and coffee shops always made me feel like I was in a minority, 


but photos of people are just so significantly more interesting to myself. Whether close old friend or complete stranger.

Even when it comes to scribbling, the first thing my hand moves to do is draw a chinline or some eyes.

I like people!

And it seems to me most people do. Folks see faces in everything, and if they can't they want to put googely eyes on everything so we can.
