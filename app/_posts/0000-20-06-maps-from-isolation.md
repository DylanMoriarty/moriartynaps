New York City is a fun place to be – there's unfathomable amounts of good food, amazing shows, and good people to venture to. No one has the time or energy to take advantage of all of that, but it's nice to never want for a reason to go out. 

I've been living here two years now, and my routine was pretty well established at the top of this year. Crossing states for WFMU, game night in the upper West side, work in midtown, and lots of biking.

Living here during the Coronavirus outbreak... is off. The food and shows are shutdown. The good people are still there, but responsibly also self quarantining.

For a month now, my world's been reduced to four blocks:

This might as well be anywhere!

Popping out for groceries I can see downtown Brooklyn in the distance, but it only serves as backdrop. For now, life's an island.

Before the "Great Isolation", I had intended too fly out to Wisconsin. As it became clear flying through major airports _may not be ideal_, those plans changed. I gave serious consideration to the following alternative means of getting back home...

...maybe you've made similar ones.

Unfortunately, even at the top of the month it was clear no one knew how prevalent the virus was. I decided to wait until sufficient testing was being done in NYC to know the relative risk. If there was a window, I think I missed it. 

Will be making more of these maps, seems like.

Obviously the degree to which this has effected you varies depending on your personal, home, and _oof_, work situations. But while everyone's physically apart, it's been interesting to see the similarities in experience. A certain baseline of trauma that seems universal. The same gut fears – an uncertain future and desire to make sure loved ones are ok first and foremost.

My '_typical day in March_' map is probably pretty darn similar to your current one. Regardless of geography, you have your homestead, grocery/pharmacy, and maybe the nearest hospital.

Because everyone's equally far away, they're also equally close in a way. The _promise of the internet delivered_, we're all connected and tucked in a screen. Location and geography be damned!

This isn't necessarily new – teleconferencing has been around the past 10 years and calling people has long been an option. But that everyone is in the same situation has made it easier to appreciate, and a lot easier to just reach out.

It's comforting. Tho after exhausting the conversation, at some point you wave goodbye and hang up the call. The illusion is broken, and once again you realize you're still just on your island. 

Can't wait to get off it.

  <p>Yes yes yes yes, the island metaphor was maybe informed by Animal Crossing. I didn't make the connection until a buddy pointed it out, so I'd like to think the metaphor stands.</p>
