There's no "new car smell" equivilant for new websites, and that's a bummer.

Instead, there's nothing in the air but cautious optimism. Sure, it's empty now– but oh boy! What it could be!

{% include chapter1.html %}1.
{% include chapter2.html %}What can it be!?
{% include chapter3.html %}

Ideally this site will be a smorgasbord of:

- Carto tutorials
- Scribbles
- Fondue recipes
- Quick, quirky, wordier thoughts
- Miscellaneous etcetera

This is gonna be a harbor for my daydreams. Instead of losing thoughts to walking through doorways, I'd like to catch a few of em' and give them a home.

Along with that– I have a few other goals in mind too:

{% include chapter1.html %}2.
{% include chapter2.html %}Paying it Forward
{% include chapter3.html %}

Most of the things I do I can only do because people before me wrote wonderful tutorials either in books or online. As a roundabout way of saying thanks to those folks, I'd love to contribute back to that space. I've written a bit more [stuff stuff](http://dylanmoriarty.github.io/blog/basketweavers-and-open-data.html)

{% include chapter1.html %}3.
{% include chapter2.html %}Write More
{% include chapter3.html %}

While the readership of this webzone will be exclusive to wanderlust twitter folks & my parents, I work at newspaper where the same can't be said. There's ample opportunity to do my own research and writing, but I'd like to be more confident in writing in general.

You only get good at a skill by doing, and so this is me publicly egging myself to write more. (\*_This also is me giving you permission to shame me if you see this blog-flower wilt from neglect over the course of many months._\*)

{% include chapter1.html %}4.
{% include chapter2.html %}Own the Medium
{% include chapter3.html %}

This is a bonefide blog, but I'm still going the self-coded route. Medium, Wordpress, or what have ya seem like swell options for this, but I like having complete control over _everything_.

Instead of having to cross my fingers that various mapping libraries work with this, I can make it work. If I want a feature (such as {% include tooltips.html face="tooltips!" tip="Or the musicbox at the top of this post!" %}), I can make it.

This means each post will be more work, but hey, maybe it'll be worth it. Afterall, these are artisanal blog posts folks!!

{% include chapter1.html %}5.
{% include chapter2.html %}OK, ...but why naps?
{% include chapter3.html %}

..._also_... my professional email has been MoriartyMaps for a bit. I like the juxtaposition. A digital dream catcher for the dreamt doodles of a busy fella just trying to get some naps in.

Hope very much some use will come of it. If some folks get some enjoyment out of it tho, that's enough too.

Cheers,
