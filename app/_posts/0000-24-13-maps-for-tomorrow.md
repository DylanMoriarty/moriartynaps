_Written September, 2021_

A degree of normalcy has returned to Dane County as vaccines roll out. I've had chance to attend a few gatherings in the past month, and _finally_ the chance to embrace friends.

Can only hope there won't be another winter as cold as 2020's. 

It's my favorite season, but that's because the harsh lows outside are contrasted with gatherings inside around a warm fire, hot soup, and the closeness that comes from fitting six people on a four person couch. You may have to trudge through snow up to your knees, but there's a warm cozy dive bar booth the end of your journey and it's filled with all your favorite people.

This winter had none of that. There was just one-two blows of the outdoors being the only safe place to see buds and the outdoors being intolerable.

Madison hasn't felt like a ghost town per se, but familiar store fronts don't do much good when their hours are slashed and you can't safely venture inside. Biking around, it's an almost uncanny valley effect. You recognize the facade, but without open doors, it can feel like just another passless void.

..but then the vaccines started to roll out.

[[ One hole gets filled (ew wording) ]]

Suddenly I'm in a new pub, enjoying fries. Indoors. For hours.

Then a backyard birthday.

Spaces slowly come back into focus.

Of course, things aren't quite back to normal. Indoors we mask up. There's a

Somewhere in the offices of WSJ there's a whiteboard with "See Ya'll Soon!" written on it. I'm flying away up top, with the U.S. News Graphics team below sitting for the daily huddle. It was meant as a fun thing for people to stumble upon as they periodically visited, and for us all to enjoy once back.

With the exception of former roommates and my parents, easily the people I'd been closet too for it's duration were my colleagues at the Wall Street Journal. Sure, I'd catch buds in a park or over zoom brews, but I communicated with those colleagues near daily. Sharing the struggles of maintaining a Covid Data Pipeline, to just jamming out to Spotify juke boxes. 

Before I left NYC, I visited the office to grab what was left. Desks were still piled on by newspapers from early 2020, now crimpling up following lord knows how much disenfectant spray was showered on them. The plant that had adorned my monitor long deceased. Lots of scattered memento's of a once-upon team.

Nearly everyone drawn on that white board has since left the Journal. The team itself was dissolved remotely in a reorganization, so it serves more as an artifact. Once, there was a gang of folks who met every weekday morning on the fifth floor of 1121 6th, Avenue. Ready to kick butt and make some solid visuals.

Distance may make the heart grow fonder for lovers, but it certainly cools less intimate relationships. It's been a rare gift to be back for long enough to water those friendships.

Sometime yet this year, I'll be packing everything up and moving back to Washington D.C. Unintentionally, this grants the chance to do that same watering here.

In high school, a friend made this sketch for a friend house. I'm sure these kind of doodles are nearly as common as the [Cool S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S), as is the dream that we can remain close to those we enjoy forever.

_Written April 2022_



A couple weeks before theh pandemic began in earnest, I had the best night out.

I distinctly remember tipsily waxing on about how nothing is promised - it's easy to take for granted how things currently are and get mad when that gets uprooted. Some change you can anticipate from well trodden paths, like aging.

It's 

Others are harder to plan for. I really hope to not get hit by a bus tomorrow, but we'll see!

See you soon? Hope so,

I. Knock on Wood

- Vaccinated, rates in Wisconsin. Foggy map slowly filling in
= Foggy map of Janesville, Madison, Biking routes

II. A Place To Call Your Own

- Switching jobs in a pandemic is freakin' weird. 
- Easily people been closet to have been coworkers
- Not ready to leave yet, but ain't that the way it goes
- Whiteboard

III. Heaven Is A Place On Earth

- The happiest place in the world is a home away fro m home.
- Being bound to moving means I'm not sure where that'll be.


IV. Tomorrow Never Knows (Addendum)

- There was a cabaret, and there was a master of ceremonies and there was a city called Berlin, in a country called Germanyâ€”and it was the end of the world...
