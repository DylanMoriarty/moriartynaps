There's very, very many things I love about this book.

**The New Primary Geography** was published in 1870, making it nearly 150 years old at this point.  Recorded geography ages in a fun way – while physical geography remains the same, the world sitting atop of it is constantly moving.

Part of me feels like we mostly see maps either in the recent world (such as a parents globe that still has the Soviet Union displayed, or an old board of RISK), or explorer's antinque maps. 1850's seem... surprisingly recent. Which makes it all the more surprising to have a physical reminder of how little of Africa or northern Canada were known.
