Joy Divison's Unknown Pleasures simple and beautiful cover has led to great cartographic pastiches. From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lgrtbq/oc_germanys_population_density_as_a_joy_plot_map/" target="_blank">kudos on Reddit</a>, to being written up by everyone from <a href="https://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1536/1726" target="_blank">Cartographic Persectives</a> to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/d748kz/digital-maps-inspired-by-joy-divisions-unknown-pleasures-album-art" target="_blank">Vice</a>, to <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/614935069/topo-lines-world-map-print-physical?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=topo-lines+joy&ref=sr_gallery-1-2&organic_search_click=1&pro=1&frs=1&col=1" target="_blank">kitschy Etsy stores</a>, truly, it's a well trodden, and well loved style.

Odd, then, that we stopped there. 

Surely in the ocean of famous album covers, there are design cues we can find inspiration from..<span class="tinytext">...from which we launch _our own_ kitschy Etsy stores!?</span>

There are many ubitious map styles out there – your <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#12/37.7706/-122.3782" target="_blank">watercolor paint party</a>, the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=madison%20road%20map" target="_blank">We discovered OSM road data, print and ship it</a>,

Of cartographic styles, few are more well trodden than elevation lines cut with the simplicity of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures album cover. 

Surely, there **must** be other albums from which we can find inspiration?

We gotta start with the champion of covers – _literally, the first result on an image search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+album+covers&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiB3YfY75DvAhVQHc0KHc7TBLsQ_AUoAXoECB8QAw&biw=1241&bih=938" target="_blank">'famous album covers'</a>_.

Where 'Unknown Pleasure' easily translates to rising and falling elevation data, here there's a white line entering a prism and exiting a brilliant rainbow to work with. Clearly, a great analouge for line road data. & road maps are <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=city%20road%20map" target="_blank">hot hot hot</a>!

You seem unconvinced.

True, true, roads twist and turn and overlap in ways that aren't condusive to clean straight rainbows... but why let that stop us? Let's see how that would look worldwide.

First introduced at the end of the 40's, polaroids remain strong with the trendy. Bouyed by Urban Outfitters and Taylor Swift, the technology has outlived their parent company by a decade now. Everytime someone writes a "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gen+z+polaroids&oq=gen+z+polaroids&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30.4344j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">[the youth] have brought back [old thing]</a>" a marketer gets their wings, and Polaroids have lifted flocks upon flocks.

In ’78 the Talking Heads released their sophmore album, _More Songs About Buildings and Food_. The cover features the bandmates diced up into chunks by Polaroids and reassembled into people shapes.

There are no satellites (that I know of) with Polaroid cameras aboard. We'll have to settle for the multispectral instruments instead.

Still, we can go further here. Sure, each pixel in the above images contains countless buildings and food, but not as a resolution we can make out. 

For better or worse <span class="tinytext">(for better)</span>, there isn't <span class="tinytext">(publically available)</span> satellite imagery that captures the gooeyness of Wisconsin mac n' cheese. The confusing monument that is Wall Drug. The iconic mistake that is the Seattle Space Needle.

But we can –

_Aside_ – the back side of _More Songs About Buildings and Food_ <a href="https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/now-then-history-portrait-usa" target="_blank">features one of the first false-color nation-wide composites</a>. Published just five years after the first nationwide composite of Landsat imagery, the linear notes correctly note all the applications Landsat analysis will eventually provide. Wonderfully forward thinking and a fun historical overlap between music and cartography.

Our first efforts require a lot of overhead to produce. Would be nice if we could find something with mass appeal and a quick turnaround.

Maybe a style that's just text and some light manipulation?

I hear ya. A satellite image might not seem as punk as a guy smashing his guitar. But what's more punk than the anarchy and mess that is urban development?

Let's open this up to cities world wide,

So far we've avoided directly referencing our inspirations in the pieces themselves.

Perhaps that's a missed opportunity. Let's fully embrace our muses and pay tribute. Fan-art communities thrive online, why not fan-maps?

It seems, perhaps, Unknown Pleasures enjoys success thanks less to the _look_, and more the utility of it. There are certainly more use cases for stacked lines of varying values than, say, mountain tops colored like a space rocker's flamboyet mullet.

Still, what fun to see how far a concept can go.

  <i>Dark Side</i> was made using data from OpenStreetMap. The Interactive version is using Mapbox GL, and their road & imagery data.</p>

  <p><i>More Maps About Building and Food</i> was made using Sentinel 2's 2019 June <a href="https://s2maps.eu/">cloudless composite</a>. The <i>Calling Maps</i> were likewise made using Sentinel imagery, and Mapbox again for the interactive iteration.</p>

  <p><i>Aladdin Mt.</i> was made using SRTM 30m data pulled from Google Earth Engine. <i>Map For Drella</i> is a mashup of Microsoft's building database and OpenData NYC.</p>

  <p>This all started with parodying <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> with <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>. There's a spectacular iteration of that idea that could be done using Turf.js to calculate the velocity of all roads coming out of the triangle to ensure the rainbow roads are perfectly straight... but perfect is the enemy of having weekends.</p>

  <p>I do realize this batch leans super heavy on 60's & 70's ablum covers... but it's very difficult to think of modern day one's that are as ubiquitous. Between most music being consumed digitally, the sheer volume of releases, and that we all have our own personal digital DJ's now it just doesn't feel like music is as shared an experience as it had been.</p>

  <p>The Talking Heads inspired map took the longest, thanks to taking three different approaches. First I tried to load ~350 Mapbox maps on the page, idea being each iteration could be loaded with at a different zoom/center point. Turns out most web browsers limit how many web gl containers you can draw! So no dice there.</p>

  <p>From there I turned to Landsat. Google Earth Engine I downloaded landsat composites cropped to ~350 different bounds... which worked! But, the Landsat imagery was way too choppy. There were lines from the composites visible even zoomed out. Still snake eyes.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the recent publication of Sentinel composites saved the day. I followed this wonderful tutorial on how to download batches of Sentinel imagery through AWS and was off to the races. After downloading the composites from 2019 for the U.S, merged them in QGIS, and then ran GDAL and Imagemagick to mosiac 500x500 chunks into what ya see here.</p>

  <p><i>Certainly</i> overkill, but again, a lot of fun.</p>

  <p>Unused ideas: The Beatles – where all features are white but are styled to be have faint shadows like they were embedded. Embossed hillshades perhaps? Queen II - with four mountains all named 'Queen Mountain' arranged under a northern spotlight. DAMN., but all the DAMS in a country... so, so much to do.</p>
