While digging through a scrapbook from my great aunt Dorothy, I was tickled by this postcard:

{% include postimg.html imgsrc="posts/18-card/card.jpg" class="inline-img black-border" %}

Apparently this was a trend from the 1930's, coming in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=A+Busy+Person%27s+Correspondence+Card&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images" target="_blank">varieties and different art</a>. Suppose it's a noveltly, but the idea of creating a shortcut to writing out one's situation/feelings is alive and well nowadays: ðŸ’ƒ

These are good, but too general to really be relatable to the trials of today. So, naturally, below I've created the first _Busy Person's_ noveltly card since the early 20th century: reimagined as an interactive form for you, _yes you_! to fill out. 

Feel free to screenshot it to share with the pals, folks, chums, sugars, hubbys and wifeys in your life. Watch as they bask in the shining glory that is your wise time managmenet acumen.

<!-- <div class="notes">
  <p>The map concept at the top of this piece has been kicking in my head for a long while. Came from a dream: Meandering in a museum space, from far, far away you see a map introducing a new exhibit on New York City. Walking closer, the standard .NEW YORK CITY dot became more detailed until you'd get to up close and discovered that each inch had a drawing detailing that block's history. A historical illustration with the energy and detail of a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=where%27s+waldo+page&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiuxtTT1qLsAhVoja0KHTkeCZsQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=where%27s+waldo+page&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB46BwgAELEDEEM6BAgAEEM6BQgAELEDUOoDWLcVYNAWaAFwAHgAgAHqAYgBwwWSAQUzLjIuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=ps59X67bAuiatgW5vKTYCQ&bih=978&biw=1920" target="_blank">Where's Waldo page</a>. No doubt inspired by the wonderful <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~272381~90046245:Chicago-Gangland-from-Authentic-Sou" target="_blank">1981 illustrated map of Chicago gangs.</a></p>

  <p>This is a more modest implementation of that concept. Don't quite feel like I could do that map justice without significant study. Making it more introspective saves a lot of time on research! Moving near Janesville and turning thirty probably helped too.</p>
