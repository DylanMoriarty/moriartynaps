There's no "new car smell" equivilant for new websites, and that's a bummer.

Instead, there's nothing in the air but cautious optimism. Sure, it's empty now– but oh boy! What it could be!

<h3>What can it be?</h3>

I'd like this to be a harbor for my own daydreams. Morning thoughts get lost to walking through doorways all too often – I'd like to catch a few of em' and give them a home.

Specifically, a home for:

<ul>
	<li>Scribbles!</li>
	<li>How-to's!</li>
	<li>Book reccomendations!</li>
	<li>Good tunes!</li>
	<li>Quicker, quirkier, and wordier thoughts than would fit on my current portfolio site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where's the style?</h3>

I actually had a full fledged site good to go many months ago;

<img src="" />

The idea of this site being a "dark night-time" mirror of my main site was the intial intention. After making it though, I kept running into the issue of how to display illustrations on a black background... and none of the solutions I worked up jivved for me. 

Still love love dark websites, but this ain't gonna be one. If you know of a site that handles sketches on a black backround, let me know!

<h3>So why launch before making this pretty?</h3>

I don't think many people will read this stuff. That's cool. Props to you for already making it this far! I owe you a high-five already.

While the readership here will certainly be exclusive to wanderlust twitter folks & my parents (hi mom!), I work at newspaper where the same couldn't be said. 

Given the many opportunities to do my own research and write, I'd like to be better at it in general. You only get good at a skill by doing, and so this is me publicly egging myself to write more. 

(\*_This also is me giving you permission to shame me if you see this blog flower wilt from neglect in the upcoming months._\*)

In addition, I know how to do a few things, and know from experience how invaluable 'hey this is how you do this' posts can be. Hope to contribute somehow to the greater good there.

<h3>...ok but why "Naps"?</h3>

...well... _also_... my professional email has been MoriartyMaps for a bit. I like the juxtaposition. A digital dream catcher for the dreamt doodles of a busy napping fella.

Hope ya like it too.

Cheers,
