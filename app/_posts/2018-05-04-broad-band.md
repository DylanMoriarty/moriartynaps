It's really, really easy to take for granted all the life that was put into making the machine you're reading this on right now. From the components of the computer to the programs it runs, to these words I'm typing now, the byline on a standard web browser is probably longer than anyone could fathom.

I don't think many people will read this stuff, but I want to DO ALL THE THINGS. And one of those things is articulating myself in a decent way.

Awhile back, someone introduced me to [an essay by Paul Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html
) that proposed that the fundamental question of the web, or you could say the itch successful sites scratch is "Why wasn't I consulted?"

This has stuck with me a lot, and everytime I go to post something on Facebook, retweet something, or give a 'like' on [insert social site here], it really bugs me. Mostly because no one really cares. I understand the impulse, but it's incredible seeing Facebook posts jump up to thousands of posts of people trying to make their opinion known.

Particularly with posts even slightly political, it's hard to not view a field of people on soapboxes, each expressing heart felt speeches.

That said, I have that itch. I have opinions! And thoughts. And I can't kick the notion that it'd be nice to preserve them somewhere.
