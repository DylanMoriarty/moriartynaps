I don't think many people will read this stuff, but I want to DO ALL THE THINGS. And one of those things is articulating myself in a decent way.

{% include bits/chapter2.html %}FEEDING THE BEAST
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Awhile back, someone introduced me to [an essay by Paul Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html
) that proposed that the fundamental question of the web, or you could say the itch successful sites scratch is "Why wasn't I consulted?"

This has stuck with me a lot, and everytime I go to post something on Facebook, retweet something, or give a 'like' on [insert social site here], it really bugs me. Mostly because no one really cares. I understand the impulse, but it's incredible seeing Facebook posts jump up to thousands of posts of people trying to make their opinion known.

Particularly with posts even slightly political, it's hard to not view a field of people on soapboxes, each expressing heart felt speeches.

That said, I have that itch. I have opinions! And thoughts. And I can't kick the notion that it'd be nice to preserve them somewhere.

Another big thing about social platforms is that while they promise a soapbox, I don't like that my words and stuff immediately become their property.

Case in point Snapchat, where the Terms of Service quietely notes that they effectively own any image you upload to them. The same holds true for most social sites.

I want to emphasis that *I don't believe there's nefarious purposes behind these rules*, but I do believe the "data" I'd provide could get used in ways I'd raise an eyebrow to.
