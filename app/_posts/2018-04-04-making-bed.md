_Previously on moriartynaps_; I wrote about **why** I wanted to make a blog space.

Here I'd like to rant about the **how** I'm going about it.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}I
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}OLD PARTS
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

I wanted to get this 


{% include bits/chapter1.html %}II
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}INSPIRATIONS
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


Enter _MoriartyNaps_. This a space for quicker, quirkier, and more text-heavy thoughts.

In the immediate I'm planning on putting:

- Quick tutorials
- Small projects
- Reviews of things I've read

&, of course there are a few other reasons I've put this together.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}PLEASANT SLUMBERS
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


I don't think many people will read this stuff. That's ok. In part this site's existance is just me trying to force myself to write more, in the hopes that I'll be able to articulate myself in a decent way.

Also, while the readership of this webzone will be exclusive to folks with Twitter addicition & my parents (hi mom!), I do work at a newspaper the same can't be said.
